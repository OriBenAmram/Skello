### Your contacts
You can view your different contacts, filter them by number or name. 
In addition, you can transform money, randomly, to one of your contacts by pressing on the "I'm flexible" button. You would get a message about the details right after, of course.

### Add a new contact
In the same page, you can click on the button "Add a new contact", and the right fields would appear.

### Some mobile!
Just a taste of the mobile experience. I used different **mixins**, **conditional rendering**, and the **"mobile first"** approach. 
You can also see that there is an interactive **side menu** for routing.
