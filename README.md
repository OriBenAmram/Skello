## Trello Description
Trello is an app in which you can manage projects and tasks using a kanban board. A board contains lists and tasks. Usually each project is a board, and the lists and cards are the tasks and subjects to do in the project. Users can modify the board and change list and card locations using Drag and Drop.
Users can work together and watch live changes. 
There are many other features in Trello, such as labels, due date for tasks, members and more. 
Every thing Trello has, we also had. We even added color-blind mode and speaker assistant! 
More about it in the [features section](#application-features).

### Sign-up page

### Your contacts
You can view your different contacts, filter them by number or name. 
In addition, you can transform money, randomly, to one of your contacts by pressing on the "I'm flexible" button. You would get a message about the details right after, of course.

### Add a new contact
In the same page, you can click on the button "Add a new contact", and the right fields would appear.

### Some mobile!
Just a taste of the mobile experience. I used different **mixins**, **conditional rendering**, and the **"mobile first"** approach. 
You can also see that there is an interactive **side menu** for routing.
